# odin-recipes
This is the project of the "Foundations: HTML" course.
I'm going to build a simple website with links to different recipes, images, etc. 
The following skills are supposed to be practiced:
- create and clone a github repository
- make web pages
    - html boilerplate
    - add headings and paragraphs
    - add links
    - add images
    - add comments
- use "git add" and "git commit" several times to record the changes to the codebase
- practice to write good commit messages
